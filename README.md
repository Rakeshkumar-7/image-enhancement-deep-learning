# image-enhancement-deep-learning
A deep learning model inspired by <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8305143">LLCNN</a> proposed by Li Tao, Chuang Zhu, Guoqing Xiang, Yuan Li et. al

### Tech stack:
- Python for scripting
- PyTorch for creating, training, testing of the Deep Learning model
- Numpy, CV2, PIL for data pre-processing
  
Huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Mr-TalhaIlyas/">Talha Ilyas</a> for his <a href="https://github.com/Mr-TalhaIlyas/EMPatches">EMPatches</a> Python module which made it easier for me to extract patches and stitching the resultant patches together
